# Purpose of admiralci

![](man/figures/admiralci_hex.png){width=60% height=60%}

This repository contains GitHub Actions continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows, most of which are used by [`admiral`](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral) and its extensions.
Workflows defined here are responsible for assuring high package quality standards without compromising performance, security, or reproducibility.

Please refer to the [`.github/workflows`](.github/workflows) directory to view the source code for the GitHub Actions workflows.

Notes :

- Some workflows are using github actions from [InsightsEngineering](https://github.com/insightsengineering/) group.
<!-- - Most of the workflows tends to be use by other packages (`oak` package for example). A global repository at Pharmaverse organization level will be set-up to host all common workflows for pharmaverse packages (Beyond Admiral uses cases).
This package will then probably be replaced by this global Pharmaverse repository in the future. -->
- Most of the workflows are sharing the same steps (see [Common workflows structure](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralci/common_structure.html)) (boilerplate code)

# How to use these workflows?

## Reuse (recommended)

You could add just _one_ file called `.github/workflows/common.yml` to directly import these workflows while receiving the latest updates and enhancements, given that the workflows defined in this repository are reusable via the [`workflow_call`][workflow_call] GitHub Actions event.

The contents of the `.github/workflows/common.yml` file are available in the [`common.yml.inactive`](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralci/blob/main/.github/workflows/common.yml.inactive) file in this repository. Feature flags in the form of `workflow_call` inputs are available for customization purposes. Feature flags are documented in the same file - look for the `env:` and `with:` hashes in the file for feature flags.

<!-- TODO: update common.inactive taking the one from admiral because it's quite outdated ..  -->
## Copy as-is (not recommended)

Alternatively, if you want a high level of customization, you could simply copy the workflows as-is from this repository to your repository and modify them to your liking.
We do not recommand this approach. For example, you might miss some updated or even bugs fixes from `admiralci` workflows. If you need some updates in some existing workflows, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralci/issues).

## Where to see these workflows in action?
