# Lint Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow performs linting tasks for an R package. It runs on a docker container instance using `admiralci` images (`ghcr.io/pharmaverse/admiralci-${{ inputs.r-version }}:latest`) for the R environment.

## Workflow Triggers

This workflow is triggered in the following ways:

- **Manual Dispatch**: You can manually trigger the workflow using the "workflow_dispatch" event.

- **Workflow Call**: The workflow can also be triggered by another workflow using the "workflow_call" event.

## Workflow Inputs

The workflow accepts the following inputs during manual dispatch or workflow call:

- `r-version`: The version of R to use, with options '4.1', '4.2', and '4.3'.

- `lint-all-files`: Boolean indicating whether to lint all files every time.

- `latest-lintr`: Boolean indicating whether to install the latest lintr CRAN release.

- `install-package`: Boolean indicating whether to install the R package locally.

## Workflow Setup

- **Concurrency**: Lint jobs are organized by the pull request number or branch.

- **Cancel-in-progress**: Allows canceling in-progress lint jobs.

## Job: `lint`

This job performs linting tasks.

### Steps

1. **Get branch names**: Gets the branch names using the tj-actions/branch-names action.

2. **Checkout repo (PR)**: Checks out the repository for pull requests.

3. **Checkout repository**: Checks out the repository for non-pull request events.

4. **Normalize inputs**: Normalizes the R version input.

5. **Restore cache**: Restores the cache for staged dependencies.

6. **Run Staged dependencies**: Runs staged dependencies action to set up the environment.

7. **Install dependencies from DESCRIPTION:** install dependencies from DESCRIPTION (in case of missing dependencies in parent admiralci docker image)

8. **Install latest release of lintr**: Installs the latest release of lintr from the CRAN repository if specified.

9. **Install package**: Installs the R package locally if specified.

10. **Changed files**: Gets the list of changed files using the Ana06/get-changed-files action.

11. **Lint**: Performs linting using lintr on the R package. Excludes files based on the changed files list.

12. **Error if lints are detected**: Raises an error if lints are detected, prompting a review and adjustment of the code.

Note : a `.lintr` file can be configured at the upstream repository level, to be able for example to exclude some lint rules such as this example :

```
exclusions: list(
    "R/data.R" = Inf,
    "inst" = list(undesirable_function_linter = Inf),
    "vignettes" = list(undesirable_function_linter = Inf)
  )
```
