# R Package Validation Report Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow generates a validation report for an R package. The report is triggered by manual dispatch, workflow call, or the publication of a release.
It's mainly using [the validatoR](https://github.com/insightsengineering/thevalidatoR) downstream action.

## Workflow Structure

The workflow consists of a single job: `r-pkg-validation`.

### `r-pkg-validation` Job

This job generates a validation report for a specified version of R. The report is built using `thevalidatoR` action and uploaded to the release upon success.
The PDF report is then attached to the release within GitHub.

#### Inputs

- `r-version`: The version of R to use. Defaults to 'release'.

#### Steps

1. **Get branch names:** Extracts branch names.
2. **Checkout repo:** Checks out the repository based on the event type (push or pull request).
3. **Normalize inputs:** Normalizes the input R version, defaulting to '4.1' if not specified.
4. **Restore cache:** Restores cached dependencies.
5. **Run Staged dependencies:** Executes staged dependencies action.
6. **Install dependencies from DESCRIPTION:** install dependencies from DESCRIPTION (in case of missing dependencies in parent admiralci docker image)
7. **Build report:** Uses `thevalidatoR` action to build the validation report.
8. **Upload report to release:** Uploads the validation report to the release if the job is successful.

### Triggers

- `workflow_dispatch`: Allows manual triggering of the workflow with the option to specify the R version.
- `workflow_call`: Triggered by a workflow call event with the option to specify the R version.
- `release`: Triggered on the publication of a release.

### Concurrency

Concurrency settings are not specified in this workflow.

## Permissions

- `contents: write`: Write permissions for repository contents.
- `packages: write`: Write permissions for packages.
- `deployments: write`: Write permissions for deployments.
