# Propagate .devcontainer Files Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow is specific to the admiralci project. It is designed to propagate changes in `.devcontainer` files (for codespaces configuration) to multiple repositories within the project.

## Inputs

### Triggers

- `pull_request`: Triggered on pull requests targeting the `main` branch and specific file paths.
- `workflow_dispatch`: Allows manual triggering of the workflow.

### Steps

1. **Checkout this repo:** Checks out the current repository.
2. **Checkout specified repository:** Checks out the specified repository based on the matrix configuration.
3. **Update files in the specified repository:** Updates `.devcontainer` files in the specified repository.
4. **Commit and push changes:** Commits the changes and pushes them to the repository.
5. **Create Pull Request:** Creates a pull request in the specified repository, assigning reviewers.

### Matrix Configuration

The `propagation` job uses a matrix strategy to iterate over specified repositories with different configurations. (MR with new `.devcontainer` file will be created for each element of the matrix, with associated `reviewers` field)

```yaml
repos:
  - name: admiralonco
    target-branch: main
    reviewers: bundfussr, cicdguy
  - name: admiraldev
    target-branch: main
    reviewers: bms63, cicdguy
```
