# Style Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow checks and enforces coding style using `styler` on R files. The workflow is triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) and can also be invoked as a workflow call (`workflow_call`).

## Workflow Structure

The workflow consists of a single job: `check-r-release`.

### `check-r-release` Job

This job get latest R tag (checking dockerhub container registry). This workflow is mainly here for `admiralci` developers to be warned if a new version of R is released (then a manual update of `OLD_RELEASE` env variable need to be done).
Note: If latest R tag is different from `OLD_RELEASE` this job will end-up will fail status.

#### Inputs

- `r-version`: The version of R to use. Default is 'release'.

#### Steps

1. **List rocker/rstudio tags:** Request dockerhub registry to list all available tags. Then apply regexp pattern to retrieve only tags with `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$` pattern, and take the highest tag.

- `workflow_dispatch`: Manually triggered workflow with optional inputs.
- `schedule`: Run every sunday at midnight UTC.

### Permissions

- `contents: write`: Write permissions for repository contents.
