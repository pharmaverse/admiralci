# Check URLs Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow checks URLs in documentation files. It runs on the main, and pre-release branches for push events and specified pull request events.

## Workflow Triggers

This workflow is triggered in the following ways:

1. **Push Events**: Triggered on pushes to the main, and pre-release branches.

2. **Pull Request Events**: Triggered on pull requests when opened, synchronized, reopened, or ready for review for the main, and pre-release branches.

3. **Manual Dispatch**: You can manually trigger the workflow using the "workflow_dispatch" event.

4. **Workflow Call**: The workflow can also be triggered by another workflow using the "workflow_call" event.

## Workflow Setup

- **Concurrency**: URL check jobs are organized by the pull request number or branch.
- **Cancel-in-progress**: Allows canceling in-progress URL check jobs.

This job validates URLs in documentation files. It runs on Ubuntu 20.04.

### Steps
