# Style Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow checks and enforces coding style using `styler` on R files. The workflow is triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) and can also be invoked as a workflow call (`workflow_call`).

## Workflow Structure

The workflow consists of a single job: `style`.

### `style` Job

This job performs code style checks and enforces styling using `styler`.

#### Inputs

- `r-version`: The version of R to use. Default is 'release'.

#### Conditions

The style check job is skipped if the commit message contains `[skip style]`.

#### Steps

1. **Get branch names:** Extracts branch names.
2. **Checkout repo (PR):** Checks out the repository based on the event type (pull request).
3. **Checkout repository:** Checks out the repository for events other than pull requests.
4. **Normalize inputs:** Normalizes the R version input.
5. **Restore cache:** Restores cached dependencies.
6. **Run Staged dependencies:** Runs staged dependencies action.
7. **Install dependencies from DESCRIPTION:** install dependencies from DESCRIPTION (in case of missing dependencies in parent admiralci docker image)
8. **Get changed files:** Retrieves the list of changed files.
9. **Run styler:** Applies `styler` to the changed R files and checks for style violations. If violations are found, the workflow displays relevant information and version details (files with style violation will be displayed using `git diff` after running styler on the workflows)

### Triggers

- `workflow_dispatch`: Manually triggered workflow with optional inputs.
- `workflow_call`: Invoked as a workflow call.

### Permissions

- `contents: write`: Write permissions for repository contents.

Note: It's possible to fix locally style issues using `styler::style_file()`.
