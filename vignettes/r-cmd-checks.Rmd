# R CMD Check Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow performs R CMD checks on specified R versions and repositories. The checks are triggered by manual dispatch, pushes to the `main` branch, and pull requests targeting this branch.

## Workflow Structure

The workflow consists of a single job: `R-CMD-check`.

### `R-CMD-check` Job

This job runs R CMD checks on different R versions, leveraging specified CRAN repositories. The job is conditioned not to run if the commit message contains '[skip r-cmd-check]'. 
The checks are performed in parallel for each specified R version, using [Matrix Strategy](#matrix).
Artifacts are also produced for each R version from the matrix (`renv.lock` and `deps.csv`). Developers can download these artifacts in the Action summary page to be able to ensure reproducibility (having exactly the same dependencies versions locally).


#### Inputs

- `error-on`: Input for the 'error_on' parameter in `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck()`. Defaults to 'note'.

#### Steps

1. **Get branch names:** Extracts branch names.
2. **Checkout repo:** Checks out the repository based on the event type (push or pull request).
3. **Restore cache:** Restores cached dependencies.
4. **Run Staged dependencies:** Executes staged dependencies action.
5. **Install dependencies from DESCRIPTION:** install dependencies from DESCRIPTION (in case of missing dependencies in parent admiralci docker image)
6. **Upload dependencies artifacts:** Create `renv.lock` and `deps.csv` file (containing docker image dependencies)
7. **Upload deps.csv and renv.lock artifacts:** Upload `renv.lock` and `deps.csv` files as artifacts.
8. **Check Version:** Determines if the package has a maintenance version.
9. **Check:** Performs R CMD checks using `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck()`.
10. **Upload check results:** Uploads check results as an artifact in case of failure.

### Concurrency

Concurrency settings are specified to manage concurrent workflow runs effectively.

## Inputs

### Triggers

- `workflow_dispatch`: Allows manual triggering of the workflow.
- `workflow_call`: Triggered by a workflow call event.
- `push`: Triggered on pushes to the `main` branch.
- `pull_request`: Triggered on pull requests targeting the `main` branch.

### Matrix

- The workflow runs on admiralci docker images (depending on the matrix element r version).
- R versions are specified in the matrix for parallel execution.

```
matrix:
  r_version: ['release', 'devel', 'oldrel']
```

Note: We will change soon the `repos` element to use CRAN repo (https://cran.r-project.org/)

## Permissions

- `write-all`: Provides write permissions for various operations.

Note: It's possible to ignore some folders/files during build process, using `.Rbuildignore` file.
